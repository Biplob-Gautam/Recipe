                    For Potato Filling (Masala Dosa)
                    <ul>
                        <li>2-3 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>

                        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder</li>
                        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For Dosa Batter
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Soak:</b> Wash the rice and urad dal separately. Soak the rice in water for at least 6 hours. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek seeds together in a separate bowl for the same amount of time.</li>
                        <li><b>Grind:</b> First, drain the urad dal and fenugreek seeds and grind them in a wet grinder or blender with a little water until you get a very smooth and fluffy batter. Transfer to a large container. Next, drain the rice and grind it to a smooth paste, adding water as needed. Combine the rice and dal batters in the container.</li>
                        <li><b>Ferment:</b> Mix the batter well with your hands. This is important for fermentation. Add salt and mix again. Cover the container and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or overnight. The batter should have risen and be slightly bubbly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Masala Dosa Filling
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Prepare the Filling:</b> Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add asafoetida and chopped onions, and saut√© until they become soft. Add the turmeric powder and red chili powder, and stir for a minute.</li>
                        <li><b>Combine:</b> Add the mashed potatoes to the pan. Season with salt and mix well. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Garnish with fresh coriander.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making the Dosa
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Heat Tawa:</b> Heat a non-stick tawa (griddle) or a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. To check if it's hot enough, sprinkle a few drops of water; they should sizzle and evaporate immediately.</li>
                        <li><b>Pour the Batter:</b> Lower the heat slightly. Take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the tawa. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion, from the center outwards, to form a thin, round crepe.</li>
                        <li><b>Cook:</b> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and on top of the dosa. Cook until the bottom turns golden brown and crispy.</li>
                        <li><b>Fill and Fold:</b> For Masala Dosa, place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center of the dosa. Fold it in half or roll it up.</li>
                        <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve the hot dosa immediately with sambar and coconut chutney. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
