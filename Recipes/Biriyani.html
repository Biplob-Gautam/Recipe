    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For Biriyani
            <ul>
                <li><b>Prepare Chicken:</b> Marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and lemon juice. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Cook the Rice:</b> Wash the basmati rice and soak for 30 minutes. Boil a large pot of water with some salt and whole spices. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's about 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
                <li><b>Make the Biriyani Base:</b> Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pot. Add whole spices and cumin seeds. Let them splutter. Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and saut√© for a minute.</li>
                <li><b>Add the Marinated Chicken:</b> Add the marinated chicken and stir well. Cook on high heat for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is slightly cooked. Add the powdered spices, mint, and coriander leaves. Cook until the oil separates.</li>
                <li><b>Layering (Dum Cooking):</b> This is the key step. Spread a layer of partially cooked rice over the chicken. Sprinkle some fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves. Add another layer of rice and repeat. You can also drizzle some saffron milk (saffron soaked in warm milk) for color and flavor.</li>
                <li><b>Dum Cooking:</b> Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat for 20-25 minutes. This process allows the flavors to infuse.</li>
                <li><b>Serve:</b> Gently mix the biriyani from the sides and serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or salad.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
