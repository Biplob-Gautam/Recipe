    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For Chole
            <ul>    
                <li><b>Boil Chickpeas : </b>Drain the soaked chickpeas and rinse. Add them to a pressure cooker with fresh water, salt, baking soda, tea bags/spice bundle, and whole spices (if using). Add enough water to cover the chickpeas by about an inch. Pressure cook for 4-5 whistles or until the chickpeas are very tender. Discard the tea bag/spice bundle and save the cooking liquid.</li>
                <li><b>Prepare the Masala : </b>Heat oil in a pan. Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) and let them sizzle. Add the asafoetida. Then add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute.</li>
                <li><b>Add the spices : </b>Add the tomato puree and all the powdered spices (turmeric, chili, coriander, cumin, chole masala, and salt). Cook the mixture until the oil separates from the masala.</li>
                <li><b>Combine and simmer : </b>Add the boiled chickpeas (with the cooking water) to the masala. Stir well, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat. This allows the flavors to meld. Garnish with fresh coriander.</li>
                
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            For Bhature 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Repare the dough : </b>In a large bowl, mix the flour, semolina, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li><b>Knead the dough : </b>Add the yogurt and mix. Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. The dough should be slightly sticky. Add a little oil and knead again until the stickiness is gone.</li>
                <li><b>Rest the dough : </b>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for at least 2 hours. This is crucial for the bhature to become fluffy.</li>
                <li><b>Roll and fry : </b>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into an oval or round shape about 4-5 inches in diameter.</li>
                <i><b>Deep-fry : </b>Heat oil in a deep pan or wok on high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in a rolled bhatura. Gently press it down with a spatula. It will puff up. Flip it and fry the other side until it's golden brown.</i>
                <li><b>Serve hot : </b>Remove the bhatura from the oil and serve immediately with the hot chole.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
